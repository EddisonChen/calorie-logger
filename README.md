Calorimeter.

This is a daily calorie logging/tracking application making use of the Edamam Food API.

Using this application, a user can create an account, calculate their ideal daily calories and macronutrients to consume, and begin logging the types and amounts of food that they eat.

The front-end is built using React, and the back-end is built using a Spring Boot REST API that is connected to a MySQL database.
React was the ideal front-end technology to create an application with multiple web pages that needed props/variables to be passed between them and Spring Boot was the most developer-friendly and straightforward back-end technology to build an API.
